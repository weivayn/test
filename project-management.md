I am very passionate driving the delivery of products to end-users successfully and efficiently. After being a UX developer, I found that I’m more interested in project management, which would allow me to be part of the decision making process. This was why I decided to move to my current position as a senior business analyst and project manager. I’m enjoying my role, which allows me to bring people with different background together from internal and external teams. By having development skills and knowing the technology capabilities and constraints, I was able to provide the best solution with the best practices. However, the technologies that I am currently involved in are outdated, such as mainframe systems. I would like to work with cutting edge technologies, which could apply my user experience skills.

**PM highlights**:  
During the last 6 months, I was able to successfully deliver both Share Class Conversion and Disclosure of Interests projects in parallel with 6 releases, and 3 of them were ahead of schedule.

**Most recent projects**:
* Share Class Conversion was a multi-year and multi-million dollar project for performing reconciliation between multiple platforms and automating the current semi-manual process.
* Disclosure of Interest was an auditing project, which monitored whether the instruments (fixed income and equity) were captured correctly in the accounting system and complied with the regulations.
* Client Onboarding was a web application project for replacing the existing platform, which provided bankers from Asset Management a cutting edge tool to win clients.
Client Experience was another web project for enhancing the internal and external tools in Asset Management.

**My responsibilities during a full production cycle**:
